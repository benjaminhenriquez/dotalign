# Project Title

Coding Challenge for Dot Align.

## Description

The first section asked me to write three SQL queries to get information from a series of linked tables.
The second section asked me to write a short coding program.

I thoroughly enjoyed doing this challenge, and I hope you will enjoy my solutions.

I used Javascript to solve this problem. The html page allows user to input information into a form.
Once submitted an alert with the answer pops up on screen.
Code can be viewed in the index.js file.

### Installation and Display

There is no need to install anything.

Once the repository is forked to local file
you can open the index.html file in any browser.

Alternatively, the contents of both the index.html and index.js files can be copied.
They must be placed in the same directory or folder in order for js file to be properly linked.
Once contents are copied into separate html and js files with title "index", the index.html file can be viewed on any browser.
